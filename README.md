# **Music Aid : Songbook**
[‘Music Aid : Songbook’]( https://music-aid.herokuapp.com/) is a website for musicians and songwriters who want a more efficient way to manage their songs than the traditional method of using  a folder overflowing with printouts. 

The website is hosted on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and is implemented with the aid of the Python Django framework.

Any person who would like a digital songbook is able to register on the site and then enter their songs into the system. Their songs remain private to them and, with the exception of the system administrators, no one else who does not have their user credentials can access them. This protects their copywrite and that of others work on the system.

Once the user has songs in the system they are able to create setlists (subsets of the songs) and add their songs to their setlists. Many songs can be added to many setlists.

The system also includes an auto scroll feature so that a musician can play along with the lyrics as the lyrics automatically scroll up the screen.

## **1. Project Initiation**
- Epics

An agile approach was taken to the planning and implementation of the project. Epics were identified for the project from the basic requirement for an internet based, digital songbook. The epics were then refined into user stories, their associated tasks and the acceptance criteria for the features developed to satisfy the user stories.
