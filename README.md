# **Music Aid : Songbook**
[‘Music Aid : Songbook’]( https://music-aid.herokuapp.com/) is a website for musicians and songwriters who want a more efficient way to manage their songs than the traditional method of using  a folder overflowing with printouts. 
The website is hosted on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and is implemented with the aid of the Python Django framework.
A person who wants to use the website is able to create a login and then enter their songs into the system. Their songs remain private to them and, with the exception of the system administrators, no one else who does not have their user credentials can access them.
Once the user has songs in the system they are able to create setlists (subsets of the songs) and add these songs to their setlists. Many songs can be added to many setlists. 
The system also includes an auto scroll feature that so that a musician can play along with the lyrics as they automatically scroll up the screen.
